## Announcement

I have recently decided on splitting this addon into multiple other addons. So, we will be moving to @storybook-extras repo which will contain all the addons. This will make it easier to maintain and also to add new features. I will be working on this in the next few weeks.

This addon will be deprecated in favor of the new addons. And it will be pointing to the new addons for the features. So, you can still use it as it is. But, I will be adding new features to the new addons.

For more information the features and new addons, please refer to the documentation available at the [`@storybook-extras`](https://github.com/sheriffMoose/storybook-extras) repo.
```

## Credits

-   Thanks for `JS Devtools` for their amazing `coverage istanbul loader`, we are also working on integration this instrumentation into `@storybook/addon-coverage`.
-   Thanks for `@storybook/addon-backgrounds` for the inspiration for the `wrappers selector` feature.
-   This would not have been possible without the official `@storybook/angular` framework.
-   Thanks for the team behind the official `Storybook Addon Kit` specially [`@winkerVSbecks`](https://github.com/winkerVSbecks) for the amazing work they put into this kit that was very helpful for generating this addon.
